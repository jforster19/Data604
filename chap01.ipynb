    "On the other hand, ignoring air resistance is not a good choice, because in this scenario its effect is substantial.\n",

    "* Abstraction is the process of defining a model by deciding which elements of the real world to include and which can be left out.\n",

    "* Analysis and simulation are ways to use a model to generate predictions, explain why things behave as they do, and design things that behave as we want.\n",
